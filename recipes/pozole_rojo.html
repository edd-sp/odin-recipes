    <img src="../images/pozole-rojo.jpg" alt="A bowl of red pozole with chili powder, salsa and tortilla chips">
    <p>Pozole is a Mexican poem for the palate that no one can resist its charms.</p>
    <p>A curious and disturbing fact about pozole is that, being a dish of Pre-Hispanic origin, it was made with human meat from defeated warriors. Obviously after the arrival of the Spanish this changed to pork and chicken meat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pork shoulder, pork loin, pork neck bones and drained hominy in a large pot; cover with water. Add 1 head of garlic and salt to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until meat is tender and cooked through, about 1 hour and 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place tomato and guajillo chiles in a pot and add enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until chiles have softened, about 15 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Place tomato and chiles with salt, 1 clove garlic, oregano, and cumin in a blender; add 2 cups water. Blend until smooth. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve and set chile sauce aside.</li>
        <li>Transfer pork to a work surface and shred with 2 forks. Discard pork bones and garlic.</li>
        <li>Stir chile sauce and shredded pork into the pot. Simmer pozole until flavors have blended, about 5 - 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle pozole into serving bowls and add toppings to taste, serve lime wedge on the side.</li>
